# EHRI/manuals
***Manuals on EHRI components and applications***

A full-blown project/repository in the EHRI-organisation 
on github will have sufficient documentation
on-line as [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) or
[Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/) and this
documentation should be easily reachable from the
overview page of the project/repository.

In this **manuals repository** links to these
external sites and additional documentation can be found,
grouped in folders on a per-project base.
