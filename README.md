# EHRI/manuals
***Manuals on EHRI components and applications***

A full-blown project/repository in the EHRI-organisation 
on github will have sufficient documentation
on-line as [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) or
[Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/) and this
documentation should be easily reachable from the
overview page of the project/repository.

In this **manuals repository** you will find links to these
external sites and additional documentation,
grouped in folders per-component or application.

- [Metadata Publishing Tool (MPT)](https://github.com/EHRI/manuals/tree/master/MPT)
Metadata Publishing Tool (MPT) is an application 
for publishing resources in conformance with the 
[ResourceSync Framework Specification](http://www.openarchives.org/rs/resourcesync).
